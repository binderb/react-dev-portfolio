# React Dev Portfolio
Enhanced version of the dev portfolio created earlier in the course with basic HTML/CSS. Built using React. The following features are implemented in accordance with the challenge criteria:

- Use of **Create React App** to template the necessary app structure.
- Use of **componentized structure** to take advantage of reusable elements.
- Multiple "pages" enabled through conditional rendering on a single page.
- Use of **React hooks** to control page states and form submission via **state variables**.

Extra features included for completeness and UX considerations include:
- A responsive, mobile-friendly UI built using **Tailwind CSS**.
